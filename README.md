🧠 How It Works
The calculator takes user input through buttons or keyboard strokes and parses the expression string. It then evaluates the result based on operator precedence and applies mathematical functions using JavaScript's built-in Math object. Custom logic is added to handle edge cases and invalid input gracefully.

📈 Future Enhancements
History of calculations

Dark/light theme toggle

Support for complex numbers

Mobile app version using Flutter or React Native
